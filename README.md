# Learning Modalitities Analzyer

This project had me utilize various data science and data analysis skills in a pythonic language environment. The code found in this repository analyzes an official government-created cvs data file listing all the percentages of schools in the country that were online, in-person, or hybrid in the years 2020-2021. This script includes functions that list all the dates found in the data file, each modality of a state based on the desired date, and all the school districts found in a specific state.
